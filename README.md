### **Snake, Paper, Scissors – Python Demo Game**

This is a simple demo game built using **Python** that simulates the classic **Snake, Paper, Scissors** game. In this game, the computer randomly selects one option—snake (`s`), paper (`p`), or scissors (`r`)—using Python’s `random` module, while the user provides their choice through keyboard input.

The program then compares both selections using conditional logic to determine the winner, display the computer’s choice, and show the final result (win, lose, or tie). Input validation is included to ensure the user enters a valid option.

This project demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as:

* Random number generation
* Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
* User input handling
* String comparison and validation

It serves as a beginner-friendly project for understanding **basic game logic** and **Python programming fundamentals**.
