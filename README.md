# SnakePaperScissor_Python
This is a simple demo game built using Python that simulates the classic Snake, Paper, Scissors game. In this game, the computer randomly selects one option—snake (s), paper (p), or scissors (r)—using Python’s random module, while the user provides their choice through keyboard input.
